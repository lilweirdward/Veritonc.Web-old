                Our online registration process is simple and easy. We only ask for information that 
                is absolutely necessary in order for our oncologists to provide you with the best information about
                your care. Everything that you submit is completely confidential. Additionally, our
                support team is available with a 24-hour maximum response time to help with any questions or concerns
                that you may have.

                    One of our radiation oncologists will look at your specific case, medical records and recommended 
                    treatment plan from your primary physician and provide a second opinion of the diagnosis and 
                    treatment plan.  You will receive a document stating the second opinion, information about the 
                    disease and any questions you may have had about the disease or treatment plan along the way.

            <h1>Submit Your Medical Records</h1>
            <p>
                Once a plan has been chosen and you have made an account, medical records will need to be retrieved. 
                The patient may choose to provide the medical records for a reduced cost of the second opinion, 
                or VeritOnc can collect the necessary materials on your behalf to make an accurate opinion.  We will 
                contact you with verification and ask if there are any questions you may have for the physician that 
                we can relay. 
            </p>
            <p>
                7-10 days after the receiving the medical records, our physicians will review your case, write a 
                professional second opinion document that describes their opinion of your diagnosis, therapy plan, 
                info about the disease and answers to your previously asked questions.
