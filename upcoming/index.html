            <p>
                Once a plan has been chosen and you have made an account, medical records will need to be retrieved.  If the patient provides the medical records we reduce the cost of the second opinion, otherwise, we will begin accruing the necessary materials to make an accurate opinion.  We will contact you with verification and ask if there are any questions you may have for the physician that we can relay. 
            </p>
            <p>
                7-10 days after the receiving the medical records, our physicians will review your case, write a professional second opinion document that describes their opinion of your diagnosis, therapy plan, info about the disease and answers to your previously asked questions.

            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>
                Because the treatment of cancer is complex it may be in your best interest to gain a second opinion on your disease and treatment recommendation.  A second opinion is most useful during a new cancer diagnosis, a sudden change in diagnosis or when visiting another institution for a second opinion isnâ€™t physically/financially viable.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We have several different options so we can best fit your schedule and lifestyle.  We will need your medical records (that we can collect or you can provide).  Within 7-10 business days after we have received your records, your case will be reviewed, a second opinion will be made nad you will receive a document explaining our opinions of your case as well as answers to questions you may have.

                I'll try to get more "about us as a company" stuff.</pre>

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2>Where do I begin in getting my second opinion?</h2>
            <p>
                    First you must create an account here (link) and choose a plan that best fits you.  Once this is done you have the option of providing the medical records for a reduced fee or have us take care of collecting the records.  7-10 days after the records are received we will fulfill the service you requested. 
            </p>
            <h2>How much does your service cost?</h2>
            <p>
                    We have many plans with differing costs to provide you a service that is most beneficial to you and your schedule.  These options range from $350 to $600.  Please see our How it works page for further details.  Unfortunately, we are unable to accept insurances for this service but can accept health savings account, Paypal or credit card payments.  
            </p>
            <h2>How long will it take?</h2>
            <p>
                    After we receive the medical records please provide us 7-10 business days for your service.  There is a very realistic possibility you will receive it even sooner, however, due to the hectic schedule of our physicians we ask you afford us this timeline.  
            </p>
            <h2>Can anyone use this service?</h2>
            <p>
                For the most part, yes. However, we cannot offer online second opinions to a small number of patients living in certain excluded states and countries, due to regulatory constraints. If you live in one of these areas, you can still request an in-person second opinion by <a href="#">filling out this online form</a> or calling 502-123-4567.
