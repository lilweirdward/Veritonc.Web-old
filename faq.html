            <h2>Where do I begin in getting my second opinion?</h2>
            <p>
                First you must <a class="prim" href="https://secure.veritonc.com">create an account</a> and choose a plan that best 
                fits you.  Once this is done, you have the option of providing the medical records (for a reduced 
                fee) or letting us take care of collecting your records.  7-10 days after the records are received, we 
                will fulfill the service you requested. 
            </p>

            <h2>How much does your service cost?</h2>
            <p>
                We have many plans with differing costs to provide you a service that is most beneficial to you 
                and your schedule.  These options range from $400 to $650.  Please see our How it works page for 
                further details.  Unfortunately, we are unable to accept insurances for this service but can 
                accept health savings account, Paypal or credit card payments.  
            </p>

            <h2>How long will it take?</h2>
            <p>
                After we receive the medical records, please allow 7-10 business days for your service, although 
                we may possibly be able to provide the service sooner.
            </p>

            <h2>How do I submit my documents?</h2>
            <p>
                We are currently developing a registration system to accept your documents digitally through a 
                secure, online portal. However, we are still accepting registrations via other means. Please 
                <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a> for more information.
            </p>

            <h2>Can anyone use this service?</h2>
            <p>
                For the most part, yes. However, we cannot offer online second opinions to a small number of patients 
                living in certain excluded states and countries, due to regulatory constraints. If you live in one of 
                these areas, you can still request an in-person second opinion by <a href="index.html#contact">filling 
                out this online form</a> or calling 502-123-4567.
            </p>

            <h2>Which states?</h2>
            <p>
                We are currently operating out of the state of Indiana, and are in the process of securing legal 
                confirmation of our ability to operate in most other states throughout the U.S. Please 
                <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a> for information about your specific state.
            </p>

            <h2>What documents do I need to submit, if I submit my own?</h2>
            <p>
                We are still developing the optimal list of documents to provide you with the simplest experience 
                while also ensuring that our oncologists have all the information required to provide you with the 
                best opinion possible. The following documents are currently the standard list of documents that 
                we will likely request, although we may need more or fewer depending on your specific circumstance.
                <br />
